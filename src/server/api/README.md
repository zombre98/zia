# dems API Zia
##### The goal of this Api is to provide a example on how to add modules to your Zia project
###### Produced by Armand Megrot, Bilel Fourati, Anatole Juge and Thomas Burgaud

The goal of this API is to simplify the way you add modules in your ZIA<br/> In order to do this we tried to minimize the constraints that we impose<br/>

For example to add your modules you just have to make : 
```cpp
extern "C" {

    void registerHooks(api::StageManager &manager) {
        manager.request().hookToEnd("Example", [](api::Context &ctx) {
            std::cout << "I'm an example module" << std::endl;
            return api::CodeStatus::OK;
        });
    }

};
```

## AModulesManager

The implementation of AModulesManager **should** be instanciated **only once** in your project.<br/>
It will let you load a directory of modules or a single module via the function `loadModules` or `loadOneModule`.<br/>
AModulesManager bring you an implementation of StatesManager through `getStageManager`

Each module needs to `extern` a function called `registerHooks`
You should give them your StageManager. The StageManager will be used in order to hook* his functions where he wants.<br/>
 `registerHooks` will be used to hook your functions.

For example, in pseudo-code, if you call your **StageManager** `manager` : <br/>
`manager.stage.moment("moduleName", module)`

\* **A hook** is a function that will be called each time that a Stage is triggered.Three different **moments** exist (see the Stage section for more details).

## StageManager

StageManager will manage many Stages in your Server.
There is four Stages implemented:<br/>

| Stage      | Description |
| :----:       |    :----:     |
| **connection** | It should provide hooks* for when the clients connects to the server. |
| **request** | When a server receives a request, the provided hooks of this Stage should be called.      |
| **chunks**  | When a data it received by a chunk (see rfc2616) it should call the provided hooks of this stage      |
| **disconnection**  | It should provide hooks for when the clients disconnects from the server.   |


## Stage

| Moment      | Description |
| :----:       |    :----:     |
| **first** | It's called before middle when the event occurs (Example : SSL module)     |
| **middle** | It's called before last during the event (Example : PHP module)       |
| **last**  | It's called in the last moment of the event (Example : Encryption SSL module) |

Example : 

When a request is received :

It will trigger the "request" stage. So **you** will have to make the 
call to the Stage and to the different "Moments" provided:

1. Request triggered 
2. Call the "request" Stage
3. Call the functions hooked by the modules 
4. Firsts hooks Called 
5. Middles Hooks Called 
6. Lasts Hooks Called.

For example if you want to Hook a module Function to the beginning of the stage `request` you will have to do :

`manager.request().hookToFirst("moduleName", std::function<CodeStatus(Context &)>)`
(A module can hook one function to one Moment, so 3 functions max. per Stage)
As you see the function takes a Context (see **Context**) and return a Status code defined in an enum : 

 ```cpp
 enum class CodeStatus {
 	OK, // If the module accept the call
 	DECLINED, // If he decline
 	HTTP_ERROR // If there is an error
 };
 ```

 ## Context

 When a Stage is triggered it will call the different hooks and will give them a Context.

 The **Context** is defined as follows :

 ```cpp
namespace headers {

    struct Request {
        std::string method;
        std::string path;
        std::string httpVersion;
    };
     
    struct Response {
        std::string httpVersion;
        std::string statusCode;
        std::string message;
    };
     
    struct HTTPMessage {
        std::variant<Request, Response> firstLine;
        std::unique_ptr<IHeaders> headers;
        std::string body;
    };
}

struct Context {
    headers::HTTPMessage request;
    headers::HTTPMessage response;
    int socketFd;
};
 ```

#### Struct Context

```cpp
struct Context {
 	headers::HTTPMessage request;
 	headers::HTTPMessage response;
 	int socketFd;
 };
```

In the `Context` structure, the field `request` will contain the original request of the client.<br/>
The field `response` should be filled by the different modules.<br/>
We give you the field `socketFd` if you want to read or write data depending on the modules. 

#### Struct HTTPMessage

```cpp
struct HTTPMessage {
	std::variant<Request, Response> firstLine;
	std::unique_ptr<IHeaders> headers;
	std::string body;
};
```

The `firstLine` field contains a Request or Response depending on which HTTPMessage you are : <br/>
* In `request` the type of firstLine will be a `struct Request`
* In `response` the type of firstLine will be a `struct Response`

To use a `std::variant` here is an example :
(an std::variant is like an union in C, but it is type-safe)

```cpp
dems::Context context{{dems::headers::Request{"GET", "/path/file", "HTTP/1.1"}, std::make_unique<dems::headers::Heading>(), ""},
                     {dems::headers::Response{"HTTP/1.1", "200", "OK"},std::make_unique<dems::headers::Heading>(), ""}, 0};


std::cout << std::get<dems::headers::Request>(context.request.firstLine).path << std::endl;
```
On the fist line we show you how to create a `dems::Context`<br/>
On the last line we take the path from the variant Request by using `std::get<T>`, `T` being the type you want (in this case, it is either `Request` or `Response`).

The `headers` field contains a definition of Interface `IHeaders`

```cpp
class IHeaders {
public:
	virtual ~IHeaders() = default;

	virtual std::string &getHeader(const std::string &headerName) const = 0;

	virtual void setHeader(const std::string &headerName, const std::string &value) = 0;
};
```

All class who inherit from `IHeaders` must provide its own container to store
the Header, a headers is composed with a name and a value:

* Name: accept
* Value: application/json<br/>

(key / value, which container to use ? ...)
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The last field of the HTTPMessage is the `body`.
The `body` can be anything.<br/>

example:
```html
<html>
    <head></head>
    <body>
        <h1>Hello World</h1>
    </body>
</html>"
```

That's all !

Here is a very very simple Logger Implementation:
```cpp
static constexpr char MODULE_NAME[] = "Logger";

extern "C" {

void registerHooks(dems::StageManager &manager) {
    manager.request().hookToFirst(MODULE_NAME, [](dems::Context &ctx) {
        std::cout << "Stage: Request FIRST" << std::endl;
        std::cout << ctx.response.body << std::endl;
        return dems::CodeStatus::OK;
    });

    manager.request().hookToMiddle(MODULE_NAME, [](dems::Context &ctx) {
        std::cout << "Stage: Request MIDDLE" << std::endl;
        std::cout << ctx.response.body << std::endl;
        return dems::CodeStatus::OK;
    });

    manager.request().hookToEnd(MODULE_NAME, [](dems::Context &ctx) {
        std::cout << "Stage: Request END" << std::endl;
        std::cout << ctx.response.body << std::endl;
        return dems::CodeStatus::OK;
    });
}

};
```
